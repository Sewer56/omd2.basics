# Orcs Must Die 2 Basics

A [Reloaded-II](https://reloaded-project.github.io/Reloaded-II/) mod for Orcs Must Die 2.

The game normally restricts you to resolutions in its preset list - this bypasses that limitation.

## Features

- **Resolution Override** - Force any resolution (defaults to desktop resolution)
- **Window Dock Position** - Position window at screen edges or center (top-left, bottom-center, etc.)
- **D3D9Ex Upgrade** - Upgrades the game from D3D9 to D3D9Ex
- **Aspect Ratio Fix** - Hor+ FOV scaling for ultrawide (21:9, 32:9, etc.)
- **Additional FOV Slider** - Fine-tune field of view

## Non-Features

- **Window Resizing** - The game window cannot be resized after launch

## Installation

1. Install [Reloaded-II](https://reloaded-project.github.io/Reloaded-II/)
2. Download from releases
3. Import into Reloaded-II
4. Enable for Orcs Must Die 2

## Note

This is not production quality software. I made this within 4-ish hours so I can play co-op with my girlfriend, whose monitor has the bottom half broken. Without a non-standard aspect ratio and resolution, part of the game would render on the broken half of the screen, making it unplayable.
