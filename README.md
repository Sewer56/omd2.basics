## Features

- **Resolution Override** - Force any resolution (defaults to desktop resolution)
- **Window Dock Position** - Position window at screen edges or center (top-left, bottom-center, etc.)
- **D3D9Ex Upgrade** - Upgrades the game from D3D9 to D3D9Ex
- **Aspect Ratio Fix** - Hor+ FOV scaling for ultrawide (21:9, 32:9, etc.)
- **Additional FOV Slider** - Fine-tune field of view

## Non-Features

- **Window Resizing** - The game window cannot be resized after launch
- **HUD Repositioning** - HUD elements are not moved

## Disclaimers

- **Borderless Windowed Only** - This mod forces borderless windowed mode because:
  - It's the default/intended D3D9Ex mode (on Windows 10+ it has the same optimizations as exclusive fullscreen)
  - The game has performance problems in exclusive fullscreen for some reason on my end

## Installation

1. Install [Reloaded-II](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II/releases/latest/download/Setup.exe)
2. Download from releases
3. Import into Reloaded-II
4. Enable for Orcs Must Die 2

## Note

This is not purroduction quality software, nya~! I made this within 4-ish hours so I can play co-op with someone very pawsitively precious to me, whose monitor has the bottom half broken.

The game normally restricts you to resolutions in its preset list, so without a non-standard aspect ratio and resolution, part of the game would render on the broken half of the screen, making it unpurrlayable.
